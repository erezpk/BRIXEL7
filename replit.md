## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using **React 18** with **TypeScript** and utilizes **Vite** as the build tool. The UI is constructed with **shadcn/ui** components built on top of **Radix UI** primitives, providing a consistent and accessible component library. **Tailwind CSS** handles styling with full RTL support configured through custom CSS variables and Hebrew fonts (Assistant, Rubik).

**State Management**: The application uses **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management, caching, and synchronization. Local component state is managed with React's built-in useState and useContext hooks.

**Routing**: Client-side routing is handled by **wouter**, a lightweight alternative to React Router, providing declarative route definitions and navigation.

**Authentication**: Session-based authentication is implemented with **Passport.js** using local strategy, with session data stored securely and user context managed through React Query.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built on **Node.js** with **Express.js** as the web framework. The server follows RESTful API conventions with clear separation of concerns:

**Database Layer**: **Drizzle ORM** provides type-safe database operations with **PostgreSQL** as the primary database. **Neon Database** (serverless Postgres) is used as the database provider.

**Authentication & Authorization**: **Passport.js** handles authentication with **bcrypt** for password hashing. Session management uses **express-session** with **connect-pg-simple** for PostgreSQL session storage.

**API Structure**: Routes are organized by resource type (clients, projects, tasks, assets) with proper HTTP methods and status codes. Middleware handles authentication, authorization, and error processing.

### Database Design
The database schema supports multi-tenancy through agency-based data isolation:

**Core Entities**:
- **Agencies**: Top-level tenant entities with settings and configuration
- **Users**: Support multiple roles (super_admin, agency_admin, team_member, client) with agency association
- **Clients**: Customer records with custom fields support and status tracking
- **Projects**: Work containers linked to clients with status and progress tracking
- **Tasks**: Granular work items with assignments, priorities, and completion tracking
- **Digital Assets**: Domain and hosting management with renewal tracking
- **Task Comments**: Threaded communication on tasks
- **Activity Log**: System-wide audit trail for user actions

**Data Relationships**: Foreign key relationships ensure data integrity while supporting the multi-tenant architecture. JSON fields store flexible custom data and settings.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
The system implements tenant isolation at the agency level:
- All data queries are scoped by agency ID
- User sessions include agency context
- API endpoints enforce agency-based access control
- Database constraints prevent cross-agency data access

### RTL and Internationalization
The system is built with Hebrew as the primary language:
- HTML document direction set to RTL
- Tailwind CSS configured with RTL-specific utilities
- Custom RTL class mapping utility for directional styling
- Hebrew fonts (Assistant, Rubik) loaded and configured
- All UI text in Hebrew with appropriate cultural considerations

### Real-time Features
The architecture supports real-time updates through:
- React Query's background synchronization
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- WebSocket preparation for future real-time messaging
