Build a full SaaS CRM system in Hebrew with full right-to-left (RTL) support and a modern 2025-style UI. The system should be designed for digital marketing agencies, website builders, and video editors. Key components:

1. **User Roles and Hierarchy**:
   - Super Admin (platform owner)
   - Agency Admin (agency owner)
   - Team Member (within an agency)
   - Client (limited portal access)

2. **Agency Dashboard**:
   - Overview widgets: open projects, tasks due today, client status
   - Internal team and client management
   - Create and manage agency templates

3. **Drag & Drop Client Card Builder**:
   - Visual builder to create custom client profiles
   - Add fields: text, dropdowns, dates, statuses
   - Connect fields to workflows (e.g., field changes trigger logic)

4. **Client, Project & Task Management**:
   - Create and assign tasks to team members
   - Add comments, tags, deadlines, and status
   - Optional AI Breakdown Button: one-click to break a task into subtasks using AI (only when requested, not automatic)

5. **Digital Asset Manager (per client)**:
   - Track domains and hosting with renewal dates
   - Add secure login/password fields
   - Auto-reminder 30 days before domain/hosting expires

6. **Client Portal**:
   - Clients see only their tasks, files, status, and forms
   - Upload documents and fill progress forms
   - Messaging limited to assigned team

7. **Built-in Templates**:
   - Agency-specific starting templates for different industries (marketing, design, video editing, therapy, etc.)

8. **Internal Communication**:
   - Comment threads inside tasks
   - @mentions
   - Activity logs and notifications

9. **BI & Smart Reports** (Phase 2):
   - Project durations
   - Bottleneck detection (stuck tasks)
   - Budget vs actual time spent

10. **UI/UX Requirements**:
   - RTL layout
   - Clean, modern layout with rounded corners, shadows, and responsive UI
   - Use Hebrew fonts (e.g., Assistant, Rubik)
   - White background, pastel color accents
   - All labels, placeholders, and texts in Hebrew

Add a homepage for marketing the SaaS, but focus the logic on the internal app. No WhatsApp integration needed. Add placeholder support for future Gmail and Google Ads integrations.

Start by generating the database structure and reusable components (e.g., user roles, card builder elements, dashboard widgets). Prioritize modular and scalable logic.

Use custom states, data types, and conditionals to support all roles and screen types.
